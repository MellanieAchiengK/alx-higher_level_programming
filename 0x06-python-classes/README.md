This directory holds code that illustrates an essential concept of python programming.

### Description of files:
0. An empty class Square that defines a square
1. A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)
	- Private instance attribute: size
	- Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
2. A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)
	- Private instance attribute: size
	- Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
		- size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
		- if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
3. A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)
	- Private instance attribute: size
	- Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
		- size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
		- if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	- Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
4. A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)
	- Private instance attribute: size:
		- property def size(self): to retrieve it
		- property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
			- size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
			- if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	- Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
	- Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
5. a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)
	- Private instance attribute: size:
		- property def size(self): to retrieve it
		- property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
			- size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
			- if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	- Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
	- Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
	- Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
		- if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
6. A class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)
	- Private instance attribute: size:
		- property def size(self): to retrieve it
		- property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
			- size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
			- if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
	- Private instance attribute: position:
		- property def position(self): to retrieve it
		- property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
			- position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers
	- Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
	- Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
	- Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
		- if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
		- position should be use by using space - Donâ€™t fill lines by spaces when position[1] > 0
